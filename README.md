# Setting-Intervals

In this project, you will build a simple Timer application,
that increments a count every second and allows you
to stop and resume the timer with a button, using React.

Step 1: Set up a new React project

Create a new React project using Create React App
or your preferred method. Ensure that you have
the necessary dependencies installed and
start the development server.

Step 2: Create a Clock component file

Create a new file called Clock.js in the
appropriate location within your project's directory structure.

Step 3: Import React and necessary dependencies
In the Clock.js file, import React and the required dependencies.

Step 4: Create the Clock component function

Declare the Clock component function:

Step 5: Initialize the time state

Inside the Clock component function, initialize
the time state variable using the useState hook.

Step 6: Set up the interval with useEffect

Add the useEffect hook to set up the interval for updating the time.

Step 7: Return the JSX markup

Return the JSX markup within the
Clock component function. This will display the current time.

Step 8: Export the Clock component

At the end of the Clock.js file,
export the Clock component as the default export.

Step 9: Use the Clock component in your application

Import the Clock component in the desired file
of your application (e.g., App.js) and render it.
